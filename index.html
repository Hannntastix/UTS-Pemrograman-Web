                        <p>Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England.
                            Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Manchester City in 1894. The club
                            plays in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, and its home ground is the

                            In recent years, under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City has established
                            itself as one of the most dominant teams in world football, known for their attacking style,
                            tactical versatility, and possession-based play. The club is owned by the City Football
                            Group, which has significantly invested in the team’s infrastructure and player recruitment,
                            elevating Manchester City to global prominence.</p>
